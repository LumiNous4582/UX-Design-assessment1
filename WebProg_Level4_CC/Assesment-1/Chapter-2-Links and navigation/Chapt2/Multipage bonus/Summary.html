<h2>Summary Of Story</h2>
<p>
In the city-academy of Kivotos, a sprawling metropolis governed by many different academies, a crisis is unfolding. The General Student Council, which oversees all of Kivotos, has mysteriously vanished, leaving the city in chaos as various academy factions struggle for power. To restore order, the last remaining authority, the Federal Investigation Club (Schale), seeks the help of a newly appointed Sensei-- you.<br><br>
As Sensei, you are tasked with leading and guiding students from different academies, solving incidents, uncovering conspiracies, and ultimately trying to discover the truth behind the General Student Councilâ€™s disappearance. Along the way, you form bonds with the students, each with their own stories, motivations, and struggles, while navigating conflicts between powerful academies, some of which threaten to spiral into full-scale war.<br><br>
Beneath the surface, however, lies an even deeper mystery-- one that involves forgotten memories, supernatural forces, and a hidden history that could change Kivotos forever.
